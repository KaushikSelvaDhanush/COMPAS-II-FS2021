# Assignment 01

'''Project box to xy-plane:

* Create a box at a certain location with a certain orientation.
* Create a Projection (can be orthogonal, parallel or perspective)
* Convert the box to a mesh and project the it onto the xy-plane.
* Use artists to draw the result
'''
## How to start

Use the following code as a starting point for your assignment:

```python
"""Assignment 01: Project box to xy-plane
"""
from compas.geometry import Box
from compas.geometry import Frame
from compas.geometry import Projection
from compas_rhino.artists import BoxArtist
from compas_rhino.artists import MeshArtist
from compas.datastructures import Mesh

# Define a Frame, which is not in the origin and a bit tilted to the world frame
frame_1 = Frame(Point(1,1,1), Vector(0.5, 1, 0), Vector(1, 0, 0.5))
point_1 = Point()
# Create a Box with that frame
# box = ...

# Create a Projection (can be orthogonal, parallel or perspective)
# P = Projection.from_...

# Create a Mesh from the Box
mesh = Mesh.from_shape(box)

# Apply the Projection onto the mesh
# mesh_projected = ...

# Create artists
artist1 = BoxArtist(box)
artist2 = MeshArtist(mesh_projected)

# Draw
artist1.draw()
artist2.draw_edges(color="#00ff00")
