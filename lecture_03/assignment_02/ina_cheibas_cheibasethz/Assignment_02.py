# * Build your own robot with a certain number n of links and n - 1 configurable joints.
# * Create a `Configuration` with certain values and the correct joint types.
# * Create a `RobotModelArtist`  of your preference (e.g. `compas_ghpython` or `compas_rhino`)
# * Use the artist to update the robot with the created configuration (using its `joint_dict`), such that it configures into the letter of your choice (or any other identifiable figure).

# ## How to submit your assignment

# 1. You should have forked this repository last week, if not, check assignment submission of last week's lecture.
# 2. Make sure your local clone is up to date

#        (compas-fs2021) git checkout main
#        (compas-fs2021) git pull origin

# 3. Use a branch called `assignment-02` for this week's assignment

#        (compas-fs2021) git checkout -b assignment-02
#        (compas-fs2021) git push -u assignments assignment-02

# 4. Create a folder with your name and last name, eg. `elvis_presley` (make sure it is inside the current assignment folder)
# 5. Create a Python file (eg. `assignment_02.py`) and paste the starting point code.
# 6. Solve the coding assignment and commit
#     <details><summary><small>(How do I commit?)</small></summary>
#     <p>

#     Usually, commits are done from a visual client or VS code,
#     but you can also commit your changes from the command line:

#        (compas-fs2021) git add lecture_02/assignment_02/elvis_presley/\* && git commit -m "hello world"


#     </p>
#     </details>

# 8. Once you're ready to submit, push the changes:

#        (compas-fs2021) git push assignments

# 9. And create a pull request (<small>[What's a pull request?](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)</small>)

#     1. Open your browser and go to your fork
#     2. Create the pull request clicking `Compare & pull request` and follow the instructions
